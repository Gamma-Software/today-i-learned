#  How to generate a SSL certificate
Check https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert
Create a Dockerfile to build the project from source

FROM golang

WORKDIR mkcert

``` docker-compose.yml
reverse-proxy-https-helper:
  build: generate-ssl
  container_name: tls-proxy-helper
  command: "-cert-file /etc/ssl/traefik/local-cert.pem -key-file /etc/ssl/traefik/local-key.pem 'pival.lan' '*.pival.lan'"
  volumes:
    - certs:/etc/ssl/traefik

# Redirection of domain in a local network
When you have a dns proxy like a pihole in your local network you can map an external domain that you own like my-domain.com and host in a local machine to a local dns record (it should be that local machine).

# Docker networks
Docker seems to have a limit of networks. Don't forget to prune unused networks with the command `docker network prune`
