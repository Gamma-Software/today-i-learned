# Bash jq

I learned how to to use jq and filter the files


# To test Docker on a free cloud server
It is possible to run multiple instances (5 docker instances max) and open ports to test the image in a free cloud server.

# kebab-case
The kekab-case is a naming convention like so "kebab-case". It is a lower case with a "-" instead of a space. https://www.theserverside.com/definition/Kebab-case

#  How to generate a SSL certificate
Check https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert
Create a Dockerfile to build the project from source
```Dockerfile
FROM golang

RUN git clone https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert
WORKDIR mkcert
RUN go build -ldflags "-X main.Version=$(git describe --tags)"

ENTRYPOINT [ "./mkcert"]
```
Then create a *docker-compose.yml* file that will execute the script to generate the certificates in a permanent data
``` docker-compose.yml
reverse-proxy-https-helper:
  build: generate-ssl
  container_name: tls-proxy-helper
  command: "-cert-file /etc/ssl/traefik/local-cert.pem -key-file /etc/ssl/traefik/local-key.pem 'pival.lan' '*.pival.lan'"
  volumes:
    - certs:/etc/ssl/traefik
  networks:
    - traefik_default
```
# Redirection of domain in a local network
When you have a dns proxy like a pihole in your local network you can map an external domain that you own like my-domain.com and host in a local machine to a local dns record (it should be that local machine).

# Docker networks
Docker seems to have a limit of networks. Don't forget to prune unused networks with the command `docker network prune`

# SSH to a specific user
Will add the user rights to all the files/folders you'll copy or move to the host

# Login to Ubuntu user without gui
In the login menu do the combination "Ctrl+alt+F2" and connect in command line

# Use Docker as a proxy  app
You can use Docker as a proxy to all the applications you want to use and do not want to install on your machine.\
For instance you pull alpine/ansible as such `docker pull alpine/ansible` and add an alias to the construction of the container and proxy the response back to the current tty. The alias is `alias ansible="docker run -ti --rm -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws -v $(pwd):/apps -w /apps alpine/ansible ansible"`.\
You can now invoke the ansible commands like you had Ansible installed on your machine in the first place, as such: `ansible --version`.
The result should look like this:
```
ansible 2.10.5
  config file = None
  configured module search path = ['/root/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.8.8 (default, Mar 15 2021, 13:10:14) [GCC 10.2.1 20201203]
```
One of the downside is that the simple command `--version` takes 3x times to be invoked compared to invoking it on a fresh install on the machine. This is due to the time taken by docker to create the container but is not proportionnal to the time of ansible command execution.

# Create and copy a SSH key on remote machine
Create: `ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f sysadminkey`
Copy the Key: `ssh-copy-id sysadmin@paybills.pival.lan`
Now you can ssh to the machine: `ssh sysadmin@paybills.pival.lan`

# Parsing arguments and naming them in bash scripts
This can be done as such:
``` bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in "$@"; do
  case $i in
    -d=*|--device=*)
      DEVICE="${i#*=}"
      shift # past argument=value
      ;;
    -m=*|--mount=*)
      MOUNT="${i#*=}"
      shift # past argument=value
      ;;
    -i=*|--input=*)
      INPUT="${i#*=}"
      shift # past argument=value
      ;;
    -o=*|--output=*)
      OUTPUT="${i#*=}"
      shift # past argument=value
      ;;
    -c=*|--chat_id=*)
      CHAT_ID="${i#*=}"
      shift # past argument=value
      ;;
    -b=*|--bot_id=*)
      BOT_ID="${i#*=}"
      shift # past argument=value
      ;;
    -*|--*)
      echo "Unknown option $i"
      exit 1
      ;;
    *)
      ;;
  esac
done

echo "Device: $DEVICE"
echo "Mount: $MOUNT"
echo "Input: $INPUT"
echo "Output: $OUTPUT"
echo "Chat ID: $CHAT_ID"
echo "Bot ID: $BOT_ID"
```
